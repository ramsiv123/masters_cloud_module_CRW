Cloud module course work
In this CRW i created AWS architecture explains how 3 tier web application works on AWS cloud.
The existing application runs on on-premises servers there are many problems with choosing the
on-premises infrastructure. The first disadvantage is initial setup costs i.e Buying a stack of
servers costs heavily. The second thing is we have to monitor servers to avoid downtime issues
for that we need extra manpower. The third problem is disturbing requests among the servers.
Due to this, we are unable to focus on our business.
In the proposed system all our infrastructure moves to the AWS cloud because of this we can
overcome all the disadvantages of the existing system. The first thing is AWS uses pay as you go
which means we have to pay how many hours we run servers that many hours only have to pay,
with help of this feature we can overcome the first disadvantage. The second feature is autoscaling the main feature is when ever our server facing a downtime issue it will add a new server
and divert load to that server with help of this we can overcome downtime issues. Cloud Watch
is another feature that takes care of monitoring all the resources deployed in our infrastructure
